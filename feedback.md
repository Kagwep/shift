Building with iExec TEE was exciting. The ability to run ML inference securely while maintaining verifiability is powerful. However, deploying AI models within TEE is still experimental. We encountered significant integration challenges connecting our ONNX model (Shift-Agent-TEE) with our rebalancing logic (Shift-TEE). Despite having a working ML inference application running in TEE, we were forced to use a hosted inference endpoint instead of the direct TEE-to-TEE communication we originally architected. That said, we successfully achieved trustless execution for our core rebalancing logic—all position analysis, parameter comparisons, and rebalancing calculations run securely within the TEE. This demonstrates the power of TEE for DeFi automation, while highlighting that multi-agent TEE workflows need better tooling and documentation. More detailed error messages when TEE tasks fail would significantly help developers debug and iterate faster.
